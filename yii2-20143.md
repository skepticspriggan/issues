The `git pull upstream` command mentioned in the Git workflow internal docs aborts with the message:

```
You asked to pull from the remote 'upstream', but did not specify                             
a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote                                   
for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.
```
