The `git pull upstream` command mentioned in the Git workflow internal docs aborts with the message:

```
You asked to pull from the remote 'upstream', but did not specify                             
a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote                                   
for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.
```

> ## PR Summary

* **Modified Git Command in Documentation**
The team has made a small but important change within our instructions for using Git in `git-workflow.md`. Previously, we used to mention a command `git pull upstream`. We have now updated it to become `git pull upstream master`. This makes sure that when developers pull the latest changes, they are specifically pulling from the `master` branch, offering a more targetted approach to keeping their local code bases updated.
